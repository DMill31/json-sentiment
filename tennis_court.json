    "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Tennis Court par Lorde\r\nDon't you think that it's boring how people talk?\nMaking smart with their words again, well, I'm bored\nBecause I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it\nNever not chasin' a million things I want\nAnd I am only as young as the minute is, full of it\nGetting pumped up on the little bright things I bought\nBut I know they'll never own me (Yeah)\n\nBaby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears\nIt's a new art form, showing people how little we care (Yeah)\n\nWe're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear\nLet's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\n\nPretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane\nI'll see the veins of my city like they do in space\nBut my head's fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames\nHow can I fuck with the fun again when I'm known?\nAnd my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them\nEverything's cool when we're all in line for the throne\nBut I know it's not forever (Yeah)\n\nBaby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears\n\nIt's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)\nWe're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear\nLet's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\n\nIt looked all right in the pictures (Yeah)\nGetting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it? (Yeah)\nI'll fall apart, with all my heart (Yeah)\nAnd you can watch from your window (Yeah)\nAnd you can watch from your window\n\nBaby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears\nIt's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)\n\nWe're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear\nLet's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\n\nAnd talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nAnd talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nLet's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nAnd talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nAnd talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nLet's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)"
